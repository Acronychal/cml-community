    Virtual Wireless LAN Controller (vWLC) platform

    2 GB DRAM, 1 vCPU

    Two network interfaces required (`service port` and `data port` which is effectively
    a 802.1q trunk). The service port does not have to be connected to any part of the
    network (typically disconnected/unused), therefore any NIC (even disconnected).
